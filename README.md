# Lovelace Horizon Card

A [Home Assistant Dashboard Card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/) available through the [Home Assistant Community Store](https://hacs.xyz) and inspired by Google Weather.

Lovelace Horizon Card is a fork of the original [home-assistant-sun-card](https://github.com/AitorDB/home-assistant-sun-card) project by [@AitorDB](https://github.com/AitorDB) to continue the great work and distribute the responsibility of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people.

Consider joining us!

## Introduction

The Horizon Card tracks the position of the Sun over the horizon and shows the times of various Sun events, as well as the current azimuth and elevation, in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format.
