# Lovelace Horizon Card

A [Home Assistant Dashboard Card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/) available through the [Home Assistant Community Store](https://hacs.xyz) and inspired by Google Weather (pre 2024 version).

Lovelace Horizon Card is a fork of the original [home-assistant-sun-card](https://github.com/AitorDB/home-assistant-sun-card) project by [@AitorDB](https://github.com/AitorDB) to continue the great work and distribute the responsibility of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people.

## Introduction

The Horizon Card tracks the position of the Sun and the Moon over the horizon and shows the times of various Sun and Moon events, as well as their current azimuth and elevation, in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format.

### How it works

The card will show the Sun and the Moon as they travel across the horizon from East to West. Both celestial bodies will be shown when above or below the horizon.

The current view shows a period of 24 hours centered around the local solar noon. This means that the Sun will continue to travel to the far end of the graph until it reaches solar midnight, which may be some time before or after midnight in your local time zone. Once solar midnight is reached, the view will reset and start showing the data for the next day.

In the Northern hemisphere, East is on the left, South is in the middle (when the Sun is in its highest position), and West is on the right. You are facing South and the Sun travels left-to-right.

In the Southern hemisphere, West is on the left, North is in the middle (when the Sun is in its highest position), and East is on the right. You are facing North and the Sun travels right-to-left. You can disable the direction flip by setting `southern_flip: false`. This will also affect the sunset/sunrise, dawn/dusk, and moonrise/moonset times shown on the card.

The elevation of the Sun follows a predetermined curve that approximates the actual elevation, while the elevation of the Moon affects its vertical position in the graph. The scale for the Moon elevation is logarithmic, so lower elevations will appear higher (above horizon) or lower (below horizon).

If showing the moon phase is enabled, the icon will be rotated to match the approximate view for your latitude. You can disable this by setting `moon_phase_rotation: 0` or set a different angle to match your location or preferences.

## Installation

Please ensure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), the [Sun integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sun/) and the [Moon Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/moon/) (_for the moon info_) enabled in your Home Assistant setup.

If you have My Home Assistant configured, simply click here:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the lovelace-horizon-card project inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=rejuvenate&repository=lovelace-horizon-card)

Otherwise follow these steps:

1. Make sure the [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) component is installed and working.
1. Search for "Horizon Card" or `lovelace-horizon-card` in HACS and install the latest version.

### Manual Installation

Installation via HACS is recommended, but a manual setup is supported.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed instructions</summary>

1. Download the latest [lovelace-horizon-card.js](https://github.com/rejuvenate/lovelace-horizon-card/releases/latest/download/lovelace-horizon-card.js) file.
1. If necessary, create a `www` folder in your configuration folder (where `configuration.yaml` is found).
1. Copy the downloaded file into your `www` folder.
1. Add the resources, depending on whether you manage your Lovelace resources via the UI or YAML:

   1. **UI:** Go to [![My Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/lovelace_resources.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/lovelace_resources) and click **Add resource** _(or navigate to Settings -> Dashboards -> Resources -> Add Resource)_ and enter:

      **URL**: `/local/lovelace-horizon-card.js`

      **Type**: JavaScript Module

   1. **YAML:** Add the configuration to your `ui-lovelace.yaml`:

      ```yaml
      resources:
        - url: /local/lovelace-horizon-card.js
          type: module
      ```

1. Restart Home Assistant.

## Setup

### Using UI

1. Access your dashboard, enter edit mode, and click on **Add card**. You should be able to find **Custom: Horizon Card** in the list.
2. In the UI editor, customize the card by modifying its configuration as detailed in the Config section below.

> Note: If **Custom: Horizon Card** doesn't appear, clear the cache and reload the page.

### Using YAML

1. Add a new card with `type: custom:horizon-card` to your cards list and include any additional configuration from the Config section below.

> Note: If you encounter an error like _Custom element doesn't exist_, clear the cache and reload the page.

### Caveats

The Moon phase name (if the field `moon_phase` is enabled) is obtained via the [Moon integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/moon/). If the integration is not installed, the card will still show the Moon phase as a human-readable constant followed by `(!)`, e.g., `waning_gibbuous (!)`. Due to the way Home Assistant works, the localized Moon phase name will always be in Home Assistant's language and not in the language set for the card via the `language` option.
